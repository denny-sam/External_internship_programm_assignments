# TextBoxes++: A Single-Shot Oriented Scene Text Detector

### Introduction
This is an application for scene text detection (TextBoxes++) and recognition (CRNN).

TextBoxes++ is a unified framework for oriented scene text detection with a single network. It is an extended work of [TextBoxes](https://github.com/MhLiao/TextBoxes). [CRNN](https://github.com/bgshih/crnn) is an open-source text recognizer. 
The code of TextBoxes++ is based on [SSD](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) and [TextBoxes](https://github.com/MhLiao/TextBoxes). The code of CRNN is modified from [CRNN](https://github.com/bgshih/crnn).

### Requirements

**NOTE** There is partial support for a docker image. See `docker/README.md`. (Thank you for the PR from [@mdbenito](https://github.com/mdbenito))

    Torch7 for CRNN; 
    g++-5; cuda8.0; cudnn V5.1 (cudnn 6 and cudnn 7 may fail); opencv3.0
  
Please refer to [Caffe Installation](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_apt.html) to ensure other dependencies;

### Installation

1. compile TextBoxes++ (This is a modified version of caffe so you do not need to install the official caffe)
  ```Shell
  # Modify Makefile.config according to your Caffe installation.
  cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
  make -j8
  # Make sure to include $CAFFE_ROOT/python to your PYTHONPATH.
  make py
  ```
2. compile CRNN (Please refer to [CRNN](https://github.com/bgshih/crnn) if you have trouble with the compilation.)
  ```Shell
  cd crnn/src/
  sh build_cpp.sh
  ```
  
### Models
1. pre-trained model on SynthText (used for training):
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kpv17f3syio95vn/model_pre_train_syn.caffemodel?dl=0); 
[BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1htV2j4K)

2. model trained on ICDAR 2015 Incidental Text (used for testing):
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9znpiqpah8rir9c/model_icdar15.caffemodel?dl=0); 
[BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1bqekTun)
    
    Please place the above models in "./models/"
    
    If your data is hugely different from ICDAR 2015 Incidental Textï¼Œyou'd better train it on your own data based on the pre-trained model on SynthText.

3. CRNN model:
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kmi62qxm9z08o6h/model_crnn.t7?dl=0);
[BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jJwmneI)

    Please place the crnn model in "./crnn/model/"

### Demo 
Download the ICDAR 2015 model and place it in "./models/"
  ```Shell
  python examples/text/demo.py
  ```
The detection results and recognition results are in "./demo_images"

### Train

#### Create lmdb data

1. convert ground truth into "xml" form: [example.xml](./data/example.xml)
    
2. create train/test lists (train.txt / test.txt) in "./data/text/" with the following form: 

        path_to_example1.jpg path_to_example1.xml
        path_to_example2.jpg path_to_example2.xml
            
3. Run "./data/text/creat_data.sh"
    
#### Start training
    
    1. modify the lmdb path in modelConfig.py
    2. Run "python examples/text/train.py"
